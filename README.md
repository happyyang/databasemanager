databasemanager
===============

I'm working on making it so one class can handle multiple databases.

A simple SQLite Database manager that handles threading/synchronization issues

If you're just using this class as it currently is, just copy/paste the source into a new java file in your Andriod project

A very similar implentation of this is included in my Android SQLite Library found at http://androidsqlitelibrary.com/

I personally don't recommend using Android's SQLiteDatabase and SQLiteOpenHelper classes directly. There are quite a few other options, such as greenDao, sugarOrm, OrmLite for Android, JQL (mine), and more. I'm working on compiling a list of options with some basic about pages and how-to guides on my forum at http://forum.jakar.co/android-sqlite/1396714536/ (which will soon be moved to the above site) so that you can compare and choose which is best for you.
